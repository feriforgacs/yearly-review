        <h1>Year in review</h1>
        <h2>&#8725; 2019</h2>
        <p>This was my first year as a full-time maker and this site is a summary about the products I built this year, my results, new things I learned and a few other stuff.</p>

        <h3>&#8725; Finance</h3>
        <p>Financially, this wasn't a great year. I would say it was a tragedy. Although I made more than one sales (17 to be exact) that didn't even cover my product-related expenses.</p>

        <p>I could acquire a few users with all the products I launched and based on the stats from Google Analytics I reached a few thousand people.

        <h3>&#8725; Tech stack</h3>
        <img src="assets/images/tech-stack.png" alt="tech stack" />
        <p>Learning new things and refreshing my dev skills was one of my goals after I <a href="https://feriforgacs.me/2019/01/18/back-on-the-dev-train/" target="_blank">"returned to the keyboard"</a>, so I started the year by getting familiar with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to set up my personal site.</p>

        <p>After that, I completed the <a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript 30</a> course which was on my list for a while and I used my newly acquired knowledge to build the <a href="https://thehashtagcalendar.com" target="_blank">HashtagCalendar</a>.</p>

        <p>For Quizy (which I haven't launched officially) I used <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> to set up my local dev environment and as the core feature of this product was to store the collected information in a Google spreadsheet, I got familiar with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api" target="_blank">Google Sheets API</a>.</p>

        <p>This was the first time I configured a VPS (<a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=a77f8741bcc1f023751b663adf52116c6490ad80" target="_blank">on Linode</a>) to host my application. Luckily, I had some dev ops experience previously, so at least I know what to search for. First, I created a simple LEMP environment, later I also had to set up Node for other projects.</p>

        <p>Although I didn't officially launch Quizy, it became the first application where I had to implement some kind of payment gateway. For that, I used <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com" target="_blank">Braintree</a> (and their Drop-in UI).</p>

        <p>While building CreativeDevJobs I became familiar with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/job-posting" target="_blank">Google Jobs API</a> and also used <a href="https://developers.google.com/amp" target="_blank">AMP</a> for the first time.</p>

        <p>For TWiS I had to recall my Facebook API knowledge, but this time I implemented some Instagram endpoints. A few things has changed since I last used their API, but most of it was the same.</p>

        <p>Story View bacame my first WordPress plugin completely developed by me. Because it is a premium plugin, I also had to figure out how to handle the automatic upgrade process.</p>

        <p>I probably learned the most while building Maker Goals Menubar. Almost all the things I used were new for me (
          <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron</a>, 
          <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a>,
          <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/" target="_blank">Apollo</a>,
          <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>,
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>,
          <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>
          ). 
          Luckily, I could use this knowledge later on to build my upcoming products.</p>

        <p>And I also used <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> the first time for one of my applications.</p>

        <p>I knew that I only scratched the surface of these tools, so I completed a basic <a href="https://learnnode.com/" target="_blank">Node.js course</a> to strengthen my knowledge. And I used it to build Re-Product for <a href="https://fixathon.io/" target="_blank">Fixathon</a>.</p>

        <p>Gift Hunt became the first WordPress plugin I submitted to the WordPress plugin directory, so I became familiar with most of their requirements while I was working on the plugin.</p>

        <p>And Discount Hunt was the product where I used most of the things I learned while I was building Maker Goals Menubar. React, Node.js, GraphQL, MongoDB, and Koa.js were my tools to complete this app. Oh, and of course, I got familiar with the requirements to submit an app to the Shopify App Store.</p>

        <p>To learn all these things I used free video tutorials, blog posts, and other free resources most of the time. Luckily, the quality of freely available content is really high and this was it was easy to acquire new knowledge.</p>

        <p>I'm extremely thankful for <a href="https://wesbos.com/courses/" target="_blank">Wes Bos</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/" target="_blank">Brad Traversy</a> for all the great things they create and share.</p>

        <h3>&#8725; Goals</h3>
        <p>I had only a few <a href="https://feriforgacs.me/goals/" target="_blank">goals</a> for this year. Sadly, I couldn't reach all of them.</p>

        <div class="columns">
          <div class="column">
            <h4>📚 Read 6 books</h4>
            <p>I've read 8, so 🎉 You should know that I haven’t read any books for years. So for me, 8 books in a year is like 24 for someone else 😂</ p>
          </div>

          <div class="column">
            <h4>‍🏃 Run 500km</h4>
            <p>After a small injury I reduced this goal to 250km (in my mind) and I reached that (I ran 270km), but I really wanted to run 500km so I failed this one.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="column">
            <h4>💰 Generate at least the same amount of income as last year </h4>
            <p>As you can see by the numbers above, I didn't even come close to this. Huge fail on this one.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="column">
            <h4>🚀 1 major release every month</h4>
            <p>I launched 9-10 standalone products this year and a few major updates but if I’m honest, I failed keeping the monthly release.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="column">
            <h4>✍️ Publish 30 blogposts</h4>
            <p>Almost. By the time I'm working on this site I published 25 posts. That's 25 more than last year 😄 Writing my daily backlogs helped to build a habit and I’d like to keep that in the future. My goal for next year is to write blog posts mainly about my ideas and learnings and I’ll publish my daily backlogs on another platform. Probably on Indie Hackers.</p>

            <p>Travelling wasn't on the top of my list for this year and probably this will be the same way in 2020 as well, still, I had a few great trips with my girlfriend.</p>

            <p>In January, we spent a few days in a small Hungarian town, called Alsópetény.</p>
